/* ==========================================================================
   The shared wrapper around the seven types, and the assessment wizard.

   Everything that does not depend on the type lives here — prompt, hint,
   button, verdict — and each type module handles only the interactive middle.
   The contract:

     types          : which `type` values this module answers for
     selfCompleting : optional. `true` when the exercise itself can tell that it
                      is finished (the matching type, which checks pair by
                      pair). The wrapper hides "Responder" and waits.
     body(ex, uid)                       → HTML of the middle
     setup(root, {exercise, done})  → optional: event listeners
     collect(root)                       → the answer, or null if unanswered
     reveal(root, ex, verdict)           → marks what was right, AFTERWARDS

   THE `_verification` BADGE LEFT THE STUDENT'S SCREEN. It is still in the data
   and still filters in `lessonExercises` — the pipeline docs say it is what
   decides what the portal publishes first, and that is a publishing decision,
   not information for someone who is studying. Telling a student "structural
   check only" warns them that this exercise may be no good; if it may be no
   good, it should not have been published.

   THE ASSESSMENT WIZARD — one question at a time.

   Stacking seven exercises on one page makes people scroll to find where they
   left off, and shows all at once a volume that intimidates. One at a time
   gives focus, and the row of markers at the top says how much is left without
   taking up space.

   The markers are CLICKABLE: on a paper exam you skip the hard one and come
   back later, and blocking progress until you get it right would turn an
   assessment into a gate. The whole track is already a recommendation, not a
   lock — the assessment could not be stricter than it.
