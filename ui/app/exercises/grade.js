/* ==========================================================================
   Grading — only what can be graded by pure comparison.

   Four of the seven types close on the client because grading them means
   comparing two values: one choice, a set, a sequence, a mapping. The other
   three need a server — `code` and `expected-output` run code, and
   `expression-answer` needs symbolic equivalence (sympy). None of the three
   can be faked in the browser without lying about the result.

   Nothing here reads the DOM: each function takes the exercise and the answer
   that was already collected.

   The exercise fields (`type`, `choices`, `items`, `pairs`) are the pipeline's
   contract, not ours: they are named exactly as the tool emits them.

         In PRACTICE the feedback is immediate — a wrong pair comes undone on
         the spot — so the final mapping is ALWAYS right and comparing it to the
         key would give everyone 100%. The measure becomes the PATH: how many
         pairs were tried and refused before it closed. Zero mistakes is a pass.
         It is the pipeline's yardstick applied to the process: getting there by
         elimination does not count as knowing.

         In an EXAM nothing is checked as it lands, so there is no path — the
         mapping is where the student put it, and the mapping is the answer.
         That is also how the server grades one, and the two have to agree or a
         course exam and a track exam would score the same paper differently
         depending on whether a backend was configured. */
