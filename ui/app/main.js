   Student Portal — boot.

   LOAD ORDER, and it matters: `dados.js`, the dictionaries and `i18n-runtime.js`
   are CLASSIC scripts, loaded before this module by index.html. Functions
   declared there (`txt`, `applyLanguage`, `saveBase`…) live in the global
   scope and are visible here; the reverse is not automatic, so what the runtime
   needs from us is published by hand just below. It is the price of reusing the
   vitrine's i18n without touching it — and it is cheap next to rewriting five
   languages.

   Those global names stay in Portuguese because `i18n-runtime.js` is a verbatim
   copy of the vitrine's and looks them up by name.

   ONE NAVIGATION SURFACE AT A TIME, and the enforcement was half-written. Any

   track picker, the account menu and the language picker. Nothing went the
   other way: opening one of those left the drawer standing, and the two then
   overlapped.

   Overlapped, not merely coexisted. The bar is `position:fixed; z-index:100`,
   which makes it a stacking context, so a menu inside it cannot rise above the
   drawer's 110 however large its own z-index is — the track names came out
   sliced down their left edge by the drawer sitting on top of them.

   FIXED BY THE INTERACTION AND NOT THE PAINT ORDER, for two reasons. The bar's
   z-index lives in base.css, which is a copy shared with the vitrine and the
   staff console, so raising it there is a change in three repositories to
   settle an argument in one. And the veil deliberately starts at 64px, leaving
   the bar reachable while the drawer is open — that is a decision, and the
