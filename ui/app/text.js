/* ---------- copying the code ----------

   THE BUTTON COPIES A PROGRAM, NOT A SCREEN REGION. In an `example` the code is
   deliberately cut into snippets with a note beside each one, and that is the
   whole point of the block — but nobody wants a third of a program. So the
   button gathers EVERY snippet of the block, in order, and hands over the file
   as it would be written. It is what gobyexample.com does, and it is the same
   argument the block itself makes: the right column is one file.

   The output of an `example` is not copyable. It is what the program prints,
   not something anyone pastes into an editor — offering it would be offering
   the wrong half.

   `textContent` is what reads the code back, and that is deliberate rather than
   convenient: the snippets go through `highlight()` and come out wrapped in
   `<span>`s, so anything reading `innerHTML` would paste markup. The browser
   also decodes the entities `esc()` wrote, which is exactly the round trip we
   want — what is copied is what the author typed. */

/* The prose of a lesson section. Six block forms, and nothing beyond them:

     ['a', 'b']                    → list
     { code: 'css', text: … }     → code block
     { image: url, caption, alt }  → figure
     { svg: '<svg…>', caption }    → diagram drawn right here
     { example: { … } }            → annotated code, Go By Example style

   The code block arrived when the first PRACTICAL course was written. In
   `web-fundamentals`, which is conceptual, a backtick mid-sentence was enough;
   in `html-css` there is no way to teach a selector without showing it over
   three lines with the indentation intact. The content asked for it, the
   architecture did not foresee it — and that is why the shape is still only
   what the content uses.

   It reuses `.code-block`, the same component the exercises use: code looks the
   same wherever it shows up in the portal.

   Deliberately not Markdown. The real content will come from a database in
   Stage 2, and inventing a dialect now would only create a migration.

   The block keys stay in Portuguese because they are content-file fields, and
   the content files are written by the school. */

           returns, and falls back to plain escaped text for a language it does
           not know, so a block with no label is exactly what it was.

           The bar renders even with no language to show: it carries the copy
           button, and a block you cannot copy because its author left the label
           out would be an odd thing to explain. */

/* ---------- figure ----------

   TWO FORMS, and the difference is not style: it is where the pixel comes from.

   `image` is a file — a screenshot, a photo, an exported diagram. It is what
   the real content will use, served from a CDN.

   `svg` is a drawing WRITTEN HERE, which enters the document and therefore
   inherits the theme's colours. A diagram exported as a PNG is born with a
   background, and that background is wrong on half the visits — the portal has
   a light and a dark theme, and students switch. A concept diagram, which is
   lines and labels, is better inline.

   The `svg` is NOT escaped: it is our own markup, written in the content file,
   like the track graph. If content ever comes from outside, this is the field
   that needs sanitising — and this comment exists so the question does not slip
   by on the day that happens. */

/* ---------- code as an example, Go By Example style ----------

   THE SHAPE IS gobyexample.com's, and it is simpler than the first attempt
   here: the explanation on one side, the program on the other, each note at the
   HEIGHT of the snippet it comments on.

   What changed from the earlier version, and why:

   1. THE NOTE GOES ON THE LEFT, the code on the right. You read the
      explanation and then look sideways — which is the order in which a person
      learns. With the code first, they read something they do not yet know
      what it is.
   2. THERE IS NO LINE BETWEEN SNIPPETS. The lines turned the program into a
      table of pieces, which is exactly what this block exists to avoid: the
      program is ONE file, and the right column has to look like a file.
      Continuity is the whole argument.

   The highlighting comes from further down this file, in three colours — red
   for the structure of the language, blue for literals, white for the rest.

     { example: {
         language: 'css',
         file: 'bar.css',                    // optional
         parts: [ { code: '…', note: 'why this' }, … ],
         output: '…'                               // optional
     } }

   On a narrow screen the two columns become one, with the note BEFORE the
   snippet: reading the explanation and then the code is the order that works
   without the sideways alignment tying the two together. */

/* ---------- syntax highlighting ----------

   IT LIVES HERE, AND NOT IN A MODULE OF ITS OWN, for a mechanical reason: it
   needs `esc`, and `esc` lives here. Splitting them would create an import
   cycle — which `bundle.py` refuses, and rightly so. It is also coherent: this
   file is the one that turns content into HTML, and highlighting is that.

   THREE COLOURS, AND THEY ARE THE BRAND'S: red (`--amber`) for what is the
   structure of the language, blue (`--phosphor`) for what is a literal value,
   and the text white for everything else. Comments stay in the dim grey. There
   is no fourth colour, and that is a decision: an editor palette with ten
   shades inside a course page competes with the content instead of helping
   anyone read it.

   THIS IS NOT A PARSER. It is a regular-expression sweep with the alternatives
   in order of precedence — comment before string, string before everything —
   so that nothing is highlighted INSIDE a literal. It gets wrong the cases a
   parser would get right (a division slash that looks like a regex, say), and
   it gets them wrong by returning text with no colour, never the wrong text.

   ESCAPING HAPPENS HERE, EXACTLY ONCE. Callers get finished HTML and must not
   escape it again — that would escape the `<span>`. Every piece that leaves
   here went through `esc()`: either the matched snippet, or the text between
   two matches. */
