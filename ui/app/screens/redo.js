/* ==========================================================================
   Redo what you got wrong.

   It builds the same assessment wizard with the exercises the student got wrong,
   from any course. It is the only screen in the portal that gathers content from
   different lessons, and it makes sense because the criterion here is not the
   curriculum — it is the mistake.

   EACH EXERCISE'S CONTEXT IS PRESERVED. The wizard stores the answer under
   `progress[course].lessons[ix]`, so each one has to come back with the course and
   the lesson it came from; passing a single context would record the correct
   answer against the wrong lesson, and the performance screen would start lying
   about where the person improved.
