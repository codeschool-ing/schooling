/* ==========================================================================
   Certificates.

   TWO UNITS NOW, NOT ONE. There used to be only a COURSE certificate, because a
   course was the only unit the portal measured. With the track exam there is a
   second: whoever finishes the courses on the path and passes the track's final
   exam takes home a certificate for the whole track.

   That partly answers — and only partly — the question the vitrine's README left
   open about the "intermediate unit". The track is the BIG unit; the real
   question is whether something exists between a 40-hour course and a 400-hour
   track. It stays open, and it stays cheap while no certificate has been issued
   to a real student.

   THE CERTIFICATE NOW REQUIRES THE EXAM. Completing every section says the
   person WENT THROUGH the material — and since moving on is completing, going
   through is nearly automatic. A certificate that comes from going through
   asserts nothing about whoever receives it. The exam is what makes the document
   mean something; without it, it was not worth issuing.

   THE EXAMPLES EXIST TO SHOW WHAT IS COMING. They are marked as examples in the
   markup, in the text and in the appearance — a fake certificate that looks like
   a real one is a problem, not a preview. They disappear as soon as the student
   has the real certificate of that kind.

   THE CODE IS THE SERVER'S, AND THIS SCREEN NO LONGER INVENTS ONE. There used
   to be a `code(seed)` here that hashed the course id and the student's name
   into something shaped like `CS-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`. It was the right placeholder
   while nothing issued one — deterministic, so it did not change between visits
   — and it became the wrong thing to keep the moment `GET /api/certificates`
   started answering: two codes for one document, and the one the student can
   see and copy is the one that resolves to "no certificate under this code".

   So a certificate is issued or it is not, and the screen says which:

     with a backend  the document is the server's row, whole — code, holder,
                     title and date. It is a SNAPSHOT of the moment the exam was
                     passed, so a course that gets retitled does not silently
                     rewrite a document already on a profile, and this screen
                     renders the snapshot rather than the catalogue for exactly
                     that reason.
     without one     nothing has been issued, by anybody. What was earned in
                     this browser is still shown — it is true, and it is what
                     the bundle off a disk has to show — but with no number on
                     it and with no way to publish it as a credential.

/* THE CERTIFICATE IS NO LONGER A TERMINAL WINDOW.

   It was born reusing the vitrine's `.term-bar` — the three dots and the file
   name — which is the right frame for a code panel and the wrong one for this. A
   certificate is the only artefact of the portal that leaves here: it goes to a
   profile, an e-mail attachment, a job application. It has to look like a
   document, and no document has a window bar on top.

   The shape now is a diploma's: the issuer at the top, "certifies that", the
   recipient's name in large type, what was completed, and a footer with the date
   and the code. The identity is still the school's — the same typography, the
   same phosphor, the brand's LED — but applied to a document instead of to a
   window.

   `example` changes three things at once — the frame, the seal and the code text
   — and that is deliberate: whoever glances, whoever reads the label and whoever
   goes to check the number all get the same information.

   THE FOOTER HAS THREE STATES AND NOT TWO, because "issued" is now a fact about
   the server rather than about this browser:

     a code            the server issued this document, and typing that number
                       into the public page finds it
     "no code has      nothing was issued — no backend is configured, so there
      been issued"     is no school to issue it. Said plainly rather than
                       filled with a plausible-looking number, because a number
                       that resolves to nothing is worse than a blank: it is
                       the one a student would put on a CV.
     "sample — no      the same sentence with the label in front, which is what
      code…"           it already said

   `revoked` marks a document the server withdrew. It is shown rather than
   hidden: the URL is already on somebody's profile answering "revoked", and a
   portal that quietly dropped the card would leave the holder the last to
   know. */

/* ---------- sharing on LinkedIn ----------

   Two endpoints, and they do different things:

     share-offsite  publishes a POST with the certificate's link
     profile/add    opens the profile's "licences and certifications" form
                    ALREADY FILLED IN — name, institution, date and code

   The second is what people actually want: a certificate on a profile is a
   credential, not a post that vanishes from the feed in two days.

   The `certUrl` used to point at a validation page that did not exist yet, in
   the format it would have. It exists now, and the format was right — what was
   wrong was the HOST. It was hard-coded to `codeschool.ing`, and the page is
   served by the API, which may be `api.codeschool.ing`: the same site, and a
   different origin. So the URL is built from where the backend is, and with no
   backend it is the empty string — which is the same fact these buttons already
   knew how to say, since with no backend nothing has been issued to link to. */
