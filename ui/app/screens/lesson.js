/* ==========================================================================
   Lesson — one SECTION at a time.

   TWO THINGS MOVED, AND WHY

   1. "Previous" and "next" left the footer and became arrows on the SIDES, on a
      wide screen. The content is pinned to a reading column, so there is space
      to spare on both sides and none vertically — where every pixel spent is
      text pushed below the fold. Below 1400px there is no side to spare and they
      go back to the footer.

   2. There is no "complete" button any more. It and the arrow did the same
      thing, and merging the two into a "Complete and continue" only postponed
      the question: if moving on already completed the section, the button was a
      second route to the same gesture.

      NOW MOVING ON IS COMPLETING. Going to the next section marks the current
      one as done — which is what the student already meant by clicking next. The
      feedback is still immediate and in two places: the step gets its check and
      so does the rail.

      What is lost, and it is worth knowing: there is no longer a way to mark
      without leaving the section, nor to unmark. Anyone who skims accumulates
      progress without having read. It is the trade accepted in favour of a single
      gesture — and it matches the rest of the portal, which shows and does not
      lock.
