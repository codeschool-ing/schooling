#!/usr/bin/env bash
# The terminal session quoted in lesson 3 of operating-systems, as a script that produces it.
#
# THE SCRIPT IS THE SOURCE AND ITS OUTPUT IS NOT COMMITTED. Every transcript in
# this lesson was copied from running it, so the next person can run it on a
# newer system and see what moved.
#
#   sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G sudo ana   # once, on a throwaway machine
#   sudo -u ana -i bash /path/to/captures.sh    # hostname `server`
#
# THE BLOCKS THE STUDENT TYPES TO SET A SECTION UP ARE READ OUT OF THE LESSON.
# stage() takes the sh fence of a section whose first line is the one given and
# runs it as written, so what the lesson shows and what made these transcripts
# cannot drift apart; a fence that is not there stops the script.
#
# ONLY LINUX IS CAPTURED HERE, and PowerShell 7 running on that same Linux.
# What only Windows or macOS can print is shown in the lesson as commands with
# no output, and the prose says so where it happens: a transcript nobody ran
# is the one thing this course will not print.
#
# What is STAGED rather than typed, and not shown in the lesson:
# a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 with one user, ana, in the sudo group; download.img and
# its SHA256SUMS, and the dd that changes one byte of it, are the lesson's own
# fences, run by stage(); DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive, kept through sudo, so the
# upgrade asks no questions; and sudo set to ask ana for no password, which a
# real installation does not do.
# Every line after a prompt is what the command printed.
#
# Recorded on Ubuntu 24.04, booted under systemd-nspawn as the machine `server`,
# with PowerShell 7.6, TZ=America/Sao_Paulo.
