# EVERY MACHINE IN THE LESSON IS PART OF ONE LAB. The computer is called host
# and runs Ubuntu 24.04 with QEMU and libvirt; every other name is one of its
# guests, a real virtual machine made by lab.sh from Ubuntu's minimal cloud
# image. A line that starts with ana@host ran on the computer itself, and one
# that starts with ana@vm1 ran inside the guest called vm1, reached with ssh.
#
# The computer the lab was recorded on is itself a virtual machine without
# nested virtualisation, so QEMU emulates the guests' processor in software
# (--virt-type qemu). With VT-x or AMD-V, the same commands take kvm.
#
# What is STAGED rather than typed, and not shown in the lesson:
# the lab itself, built by lab.sh reset; the guest pc1, made by lab.sh vm; the
# user elisa; and facts.sh, written into ana's home and copied to pc1's /tmp.
# Every line after a prompt is what the command printed.
#
# Recorded on Ubuntu 24.04 with QEMU 8.2 and libvirt 10.0, TZ=America/Sao_Paulo.
