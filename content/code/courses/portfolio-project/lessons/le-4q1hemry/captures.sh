# Lesson 18 of portfolio-project: the licence, and what the history says.
#
# THE SCRIPT IS THE SOURCE AND ITS OUTPUT IS NOT COMMITTED. Every transcript in
# this lesson was copied from running it, so the next person can run it and see
# what moved.
#
# THE LAB IS TWO MACHINES. laptop is where ana writes the project; srv is the
# server she deploys it to. Both run Ubuntu 24.04 and share a private network
# (laptop is 10.20.0.10, srv is 10.20.0.20), and ana's key on laptop opens her
# account on srv. A line that starts with ana@laptop ran on laptop, and one that
# starts with ana@srv ran on srv, reached with ssh. The path after the colon is
# the directory the command ran in.
#
#   sudo cp ../../lab.sh /var/tmp/lab.sh          # the project's history, beside course.json
#   sudo -u ana -i bash /path/to/captures.sh      # on laptop
#
# The project is loanbook, built step by step by lab.sh with the dates written
# there; `lab stage N` rebuilds ~/loanbook at step N, quietly.
#
# Both machines are containers (systemd-nspawn) on the computer that recorded
# the course, and srv's /etc/containers/containers.conf turns off the pids limit
# a container inside a container cannot have. Nothing a lesson shows depends
# on it.
#
# What is STAGED rather than typed, and not shown in the lesson:
#   - ~/loanbook is rebuilt at step 20 (lab.sh).
#   - The no-reply address is an example of GitHub's shape: 12345678 and ana-lima are
#     made up. The commit made with it is thrown away at the end.
# Every line after a prompt is what the command printed.
#
# Recorded on Ubuntu 24.04 with Python 3.12, git 2.43, Podman 4.9 and Caddy 2.6,
# TZ=America/Sao_Paulo.
